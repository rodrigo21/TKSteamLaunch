# Changelog

All notable changes to TKSteamLaunch are documented here.
Breaking config changes are called out explicitly under `Changed`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `TKSTEAMLAUNCH_NO_NOTIFY` kill-switch: the test suite sets it, so
  test runs (and PKGBUILD checks) never pop desktop notifications.

### Changed
- AppImage release asset now carries the version
  (`TKSteamLaunch-<version>.AppImage`).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-10-05

### Fixed
- Profile Delete asks first and Save/Clone ask before overwriting an
  existing profile.
- Save and Reset over a newer-version config need an explicit Ok, so a
  loud fallback can no longer be silently downgraded.
- Steam quick-launch rejects non-numeric App IDs, and a failed Steam
  handoff no longer plants a menu skip that would eat the next menu.
- Game add/clone pickers reject non-numeric App IDs instead of writing
  garbage configs.
- Mode list no longer queries on dialog open (Refresh/provider/output
  only) and rapid Refresh never stacks workers.
- `summarize().last` is the newest stamp, not file order.
- Launch-without-save now persists just the profile selection, so the
  launcher resolves the profile shown in the dialog (never overwriting
  an unreadable live file on this path).
- Unreadable (not just invalid) config files fall back to defaults
  everywhere instead of crashing dialogs.
- Display mode no longer gets stuck on the dip mode when the target
  apply fails or the launch is interrupted: the original mode is
  recorded after the first apply and restored best-effort.
- xrandr mode lines keep every refresh rate (e.g. `164.96*+ 60.00`),
  so same-resolution dips avoid a resolution flicker.
- Shipped Qt translations actually load from installed packages: the
  catalog dir is a real package with an explicit wheel rule (previously
  English-only outside a source checkout), and repeat installs on one
  process no longer skip a second app.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added
- Play button (Games row) and Play in the context menu for launching
  through the client; Play uses the real selection. Launching from
  the program (button, tray, menu) skips the pre-launch menu once
  via a fresh sentinel, even with show-menu enabled.
- Backup now includes preferences.toml; context menu order mirrors
  the button rows, with Copy Launch Options leading the copies group.
- In-app language option (Preferences): system default, English, or
  shipped locales — restart to apply, games unaffected (no LC_ALL leak).
- Display dip delay slider (3-15 s, per game, default 8 s) for the
  same-mode VRAM clock workaround; slider and note show only for
  the current mode.
- Display same-mode workaround for the AMD VRAM clock bug: requesting
  the current mode dips one mode down and back before the game starts
  (same resolution, closest lower refresh; logged, never aborts).
- Mode picker shows backend numbers and the current mode, keeps manual
  entry valid, and warns that same-mode requests dip first.
- Export/import now carries profiles (whitelist extended, traversal
  still rejected), and games clone live config plus profiles to
  another AppID ("Clone Settings To...", picking from the Steam
  game list, with overwrite confirm).
- Display mode picker lists detected modes (manual entry kept) with
  a Refresh button; apply/restore log values and failures loudly.
- Per-game history clearing: exact token match, atomic rewrite, in
  the History dialog (Clear Selected) and the game context menu.
- System tab grouped (Notifications / Idle Suspend / Night Light)
  with the night-light toggle named; PT-BR strings included.

### Fixed
- Pre-launch menu shows the active profile's wrappers (it rendered
  the live file while launching the profile).
- Display mode goes through kscreen numeric mode IDs (the WxH@rate
  string form is silently ignored) and the picker lists offered
  modes sorted by resolution then rate, descending.
- Mode list fills in a worker thread (a wedged kscreen-doctor once
  hung dialog construction); dialog open performs zero backend
  queries, and worker threads stop cleanly on accept/reject.
- Crafted AppIDs can no longer escape the log/proton-log dirs
  (`safe_stem` centralized in xdg, applied to every AppID path).
- Validate and the pre-launch countdown check the effective
  (profile-resolved) config, not just live.
- Clone replaces (not merges) destination profiles; export skips
  hand-placed nested profile junk the importer would refuse.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added
- GUI translations via Qt Linguist, starting with PT-BR (351 strings;
  CLI stays English). New UI strings require `tr()` (enforced by test).

### Added
- Display dip delay slider (3-15 s, per game) for the same-mode
  VRAM clock workaround.
- Display same-mode workaround for the AMD VRAM clock bug: requesting
  the current mode dips one mode down and back before the game starts
  (same resolution, closest lower refresh; logged, never aborts).
- Mode picker shows backend numbers and the current mode, keeps manual
  entry valid, and warns that same-mode requests dip first.

- Dip slider (default 8 s) and note show only for the current mode;
  worker threads stop on dialog close (close() bypasses reject,
  which once aborted suite teardown).
- Mode list fills in a worker thread (a wedged kscreen-doctor once
  hung dialog construction); dialog open performs zero backend
  queries, and worker threads stop cleanly on accept/reject.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added
- Single binary: bare `tksteamlaunch` (or `--gui`) opens the settings
  GUI, `--cli` guarantees launcher mode; the `tksteamlaunch-gui` and
  `tksteamlaunch-appimage` entry points are gone (BREAKING for direct
  callers; the desktop file and AppImage use `tksteamlaunch` now).
- Gear-and-play app icon (font-free paths, gray gear + orange play),
  also wired as the AppImage icon.
- Scan Library batch-add for Steam games without a config, and
  per-game Clear Shader Cache (with size) in the context menu.
- User-focused README (uv tool/pipx/local package installs) with dev
  docs split into docs/DEVELOPMENT.md; new man page installed by both
  Arch packages; single-entry AppImage recipe in packaging/appimage/.
- FPS Limit (DXVK) now uses `DXVK_CONFIG="dxgi.maxFrameRate = 60;
  d3d9.maxFrameRate = 60"`: the `DXVK_FRAME_RATE` env var was removed
  upstream (doitsujin/dxvk#5331); DX9/10/11 only.
- Tray quick-launch: recent games section (steam:// URLs, 1-10
  configurable) with Preferences toggle and count.

### Changed
- Config files carry a `config_version` stamp (current: 1). Files from
  the future fail loudly (dialog warning, launcher fallback with an
  error, validate issue) instead of silently resetting; pre-stamp
  files load as before.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-10-04

### Added
- Movable game-list columns (drag the header) with a header context
  menu to show/hide columns (Game always on) and reset to the
  Game | App ID | Played | ProtonDB default; layout persists.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-04

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: selecting a profile now affects the launch: the
  launcher runs the active profile's content, falling back to the
  live config (with a warning) when the selection is missing or
  unreadable. Saving with a profile active writes the profile file
  and keeps only the selection in the live file, so Game Defaults
  stays pristine; `--validate` reports dangling selections.
- Reset to Global Defaults persists immediately (with confirmation):
  no more staged reset silently discarded by Cancel. Profiles are
  never touched by Reset.
- Fixed populate clobbering: live preview collects no longer overwrite
  the config mid-populate, which left late fields (Ludusavi, Wine /
  Proton, notes) stale on Reset and profile switches — looking like
  "nothing changed".

### Added
- Per-game display mode (phase 1: Plasma via kscreen-doctor, X11 via
  xrandr): optional output + WIDTHxHEIGHT[@RATE], applied on launch
  and restored on exit, failures warn without aborting. Empty mode
  disables it; GNOME/wlroots detect but warn as phase 2.
- Main window Played column (total time, sorts by seconds) fed by the
  session log; History dialog gained Clear History with confirmation.
- FPS Limit (DXVK) env preset (`DXVK_FRAME_RATE=60`, DX9/10/11 only).
- Proton Wayland env preset (`PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1` for GE,
  CachyOS and DW builds); No Esync and Disable D3D9 presets note
  where the toggle is a known no-op.
- Right-click context menu on the game list: Edit, Copy App ID /
  Game Name / Launch Options, Open Install Folder / Proton Prefix /
  ProtonDB Page, Validate, Remove (entries disable when N/A).
- Multi-select (Ctrl/Shift+click) for Remove and Reset to Global
  Defaults, with one confirmation listing the games; removing offers
  to clean up leftover profiles via a checkbox table.
- Context menu shows only multi-game actions on multiple selection;
  Tools row has Clean Profiles for orphaned profiles anytime, Games
  row has Reset, and empty Remove/Reset hint at selecting first.

### Added
- Opening the game dialog on a config file that cannot be parsed warns
  that defaults are shown (and will be written on save) instead of
  silently switching to them. The same warning fires when switching to
  an unreadable profile or back to an unreadable live file, and
  unreadable (not just invalid) files no longer crash the dialog open.

### Fixed
- Config writer escapes control characters (CR, ESC, NUL, …) and quotes
  exotic keys: a pasted line break can no longer produce an unreadable
  TOML file that resets the game to defaults on the next load.
- Config saves (games, profiles, defaults, preferences) are atomic
  (temp file + rename): a crash mid-write no longer truncates the file.
- Atomic saves sweep stale temp files left by a previous crash.
- Saving with a profile active writes the profile file and keeps
  only the selection in the live file (see Changed above); edits no
  longer revert on reopen and Game Defaults stays pristine.
- Game list App ID column sorts numerically (9, 80, 1044620) instead
  of lexicographically.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- Guided empty state on the main window (Add / Import / Copy Launch
  Options) when no games are configured.
- Game list filter by name or App ID plus "With issues only" (same
  checks as `--validate`), with a "N shown" status suffix.
- Live "Will launch with: ..." wrappers summary in the game dialog
  footer, updated on every field change.
- Advanced tabs (Environment, Pre/Post Commands, Wine / Proton) hidden
  behind an "Advanced" footer toggle; auto-expanded when the game
  already uses them.
- Broken custom-executable/hook paths surface as live Dependency
  Status warnings with an "Open folder" link when the parent exists.
- New presets: DXVK Sarek for pre-1.3 Vulkan GPUs, D7VK switch for
  GE-Proton.

### Fixed
- SteamTinkerLaunch importer drops default-off (`"0"`/`"none"`) flags
  via allowlist (numeric scales and unknown keys kept) and reports
  pre/post hooks or custom executables missing on disk (cross-PC paths).
- Env preset applicability audited against current Valve/CachyOS/GE
  docs and the installed Proton scripts: CachyOS-only vars no longer
  offered on Valve/GE, GE-only `PROTON_NO_NTSYNC` no longer offered
  elsewhere, DW-Proton recognized as its own flavor.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- Profile selection persists per game; Clone confirms before copying
  live settings; profile list refreshes on dialog focus.
- Profile combo starts with `(Game Defaults)` to reload the saved game
  settings; switching (or deleting the active) profile with unsaved
  edits asks Save / Discard / Cancel.
- SteamTinkerLaunch importer: common settings land in a
  `steamtinkerlaunch` profile (live config untouched), with usage
  notice; profile Clone button.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added
- Proton log capture per game (off by default, warning in notification).
- WINEDEBUG selector per game (Off/-all/+err/+warn,+err).
- VSync disable presets for Mesa and NVIDIA (verified against docs).
- Idle suspend inhibitor per game (logind idle lock only).
- Proton prefix fresh-start toggle (deletes compatdata before launch).
- Winetricks verbs per game via protontricks (unattended, skips repeats).
- Config diff viewer (game vs global defaults).
- SteamGridDB artwork fallback (API key in Preferences, own cache).
- RT upscaler support (linux-rt-upscaler wrap, XWayland enforced).
- Richer pre-launch menu: centered buttons with icons, landscape game
  art, `Name (AppID)` header, playtime and active wrappers, optional
  auto-launch countdown (`menu_timeout`).
- Compat preset catalog (FSR4, sync, D3D fallbacks, locale, HDR...) with
  GPU/Proton applicability tags and mismatch confirm.

### Changed
- Settings dialog regrouped: Environment, System and Display tabs;
  status box in two columns with blanks packed last; collapsible
  3-line command preview.
- Main window and dialogs center on the available area; game list
  sorts A-Z by default with clickable headers.

### Fixed
- SteamGridDB single-object game responses handled (artwork works).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added
- Dynamic versioning from git tags (`uv-dynamic-versioning`); releases
  are cut by tagging. PKGBUILD derives `pkgver()` the same way.
- Real pre-launch menu dialog (Launch / Settings / Cancel) for `--menu`.
- Status tray icon (normal/monochrome) with menu, minimize/close to
  tray and a Preferences dialog (`preferences.toml`).
- Bundled application icons and freedesktop desktop entry.

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** `show_preview` moved from `defaults.toml [ui]` to
  `preferences.toml`; old key ignored.
- LICENSE file removed (SPDX common license covers GPL-3.0-or-later);
  nightlight-holder console script removed (use `python -m`).

### Fixed
- Minimize-to-tray deferred past the state-change event.
- Reload rescans Steam games again (per-process cache is cleared).
- GUI test suite hermetic to pytest-qt presence.

### Added
- Live launch-command preview box in dialogs (global `[ui] show_preview`
  toggle); tool toggles disable when their binaries are missing.
- Per-game config profiles (switch/save-as/delete, in-memory until Save).
- ProtonDB tier column in the main window (30-day cache, background
  refresh; double-click opens the game page).
- Session history dialog (last played, sessions, total time, failures).
- Steam launch-options verifier (dialog status + `--validate` input).
- Gamescope option presets (1080p144, 1440p165, 4K60, borderless, Deck).
- Per-game notes tab.
- Config export/import tarballs (`--export`/`--import`, GUI buttons).
- MangoHud starter templates (minimal, fps-cap, full) in New Configuration.
- Env presets (FSR, RADV shaders, SDL Wayland) via Add Preset.
- pytest suite (`tests/`, 41 tests) and ruff config in `pyproject.toml`.
- `Co-Authored-By` trailer policy + `scripts/git-hooks/commit-msg` hook.
- "Preview Command" button in the game dialog (dry-run parity).
- `tksteamlaunch --list` prints configured and detected games.
- Per-game logs rotate at 1 MiB (3 backups).
- Desktop `notify-send` alerts on hook failures and launch blockers.
- Transient game-start notification (per-game `[notifications]` toggle,
  game icon, Proton version lookup).
- Session-end notification with playtime.
- Detected Proton runtime shown read-only in the game dialog.
- Ludusavi coverage check (manifest entry + local saves via preview).
- Pre-launch menu: `--menu` flag and per-game `show_menu` setting
  (Launch / Settings / Cancel, display fallback launches directly).
- `--edit` accepts a positional AppID and shows a game picker when
  no AppID is given.

### Changed
- "Preview Command..." button removed (replaced by the live preview box);
  ludusavi shown by bare name in previews, like other wrappers.
- Build backend setuptools → hatchling; local install via
  `uv venv --system-site-packages` + `uv pip install --no-deps .`.
- `--help` documents the exit-code contract.
- **BREAKING:** `nightlight.provider = "kde"` no longer recognized
  (renamed to `"plasma"`); unknown values fall back to auto-detect.
- **BREAKING:** legacy ludusavi keys (`enable_restore`, `enable_backup`,
  `use_gui_progress`) no longer honored; affected games load with
  ludusavi off.
- **BREAKING:** no config migration machinery remains; sparse/unknown
  files load as-is with built-in defaults for missing keys.

### Fixed
- Minimize-to-tray deferred past the state-change event.
- Ctrl+Q quits the app; closing without close-to-tray drops the tray
  icon so the app really exits.
- Single GUI instance: followers raise the open window and exit.
- Status tray rebuilt safely: persistent menu reference, update in
  place instead of delete/recreate, guarded teardown.
- Steam launch-options check now parses real `localconfig.vdf` files
  (lowercase `apps` node, nested blocks); venv paths with flags match.
- Command preview uses `%command%` instead of `<game-command>`.
- Start notification folds runtime and wrappers into one line and uses
  the same Proton tool display as the game dialog (no more lone
  "Proton" when only the tool mapping exists).
- Dialog buttons ordered Launch | Save | Save & Launch with theme
  icons; "Launch" runs with the saved configuration, discarding
  unsaved edits.
- Settings dialogs opened from Steam no longer fall back to the Fusion
  style: the editor runs in a subprocess with Steam-runtime library
  paths filtered out of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
- `--menu` flag no longer opens the pre-launch menu twice.
- Qt/desktop environment logged per run to diagnose GUI theming.
- NightLight holder spawned twice per launch, leaking an inhibitor;
  single spawn with idempotent start().
- Empty game command executed a bare prefix stack; now skipped with
  a log line, and "Save && Launch" hides when nothing can launch.
- Unbalanced quotes in prefix/args fields no longer crash launch,
  validation or Save (whitespace fallback).
- String booleans in TOML (`"false"`) now parse correctly.
- Ludusavi coverage tolerates non-integer `bytes` values.
- GameMode/CachyOS conflict resolved on dialog load (Feral wins).
- Add Game ignores blank names instead of writing `unknown.toml`.
- Copy Launch Options handles missing clipboard (headless).
- Command preview never kills the dialog on unexpected errors.
- Ludusavi coverage check runs off the UI thread; worker threads
  always joined (terminate fallback) before their owners close.
- "Check Coverage" button hidden in Global Defaults (per-game only).
- Pre/post hooks with `run_in_shell` now receive the game's env vars
  (previously dropped).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-23

First tagged baseline: launcher pipeline, PySide6 GUI, ludusavi `wrap`,
per-game snapshots, night light holder.
